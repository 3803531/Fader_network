# Fader_network
Our Code presents the Fader network that has for objective to generate different realistic versions
of an input image by changing the binary values of the attributes(-1/1) :
1 : the image contains this attribute, and -1 : the image does not contain this attribute.
And to control some attributes of interest in the images, for which the transformations
are ill-defined and the learning is unsupervised, i.e. no image with the same content
but different attribute values is available.
